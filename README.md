### Welcome 🚀

I'm Olisa, a Chemical Engineering graduate and aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for creating clever insights, and visualizations 📊. I love solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through code 💻. With a drive to leverage my coding skills to create meaningful solutions, I am eager to contribute my expertise and enthusiasm to meaningful projects that have a lasting impact 🌱. 

For contact: [Email ✉️](mailto:OOsakwe1@icloud.com).

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring different cities 🌇, trying out restaurants 🥐, or reading 📚. 
I'm always up for a good challenge, so feel free to connect with me on Github to collaborate on a project or offer any info.
